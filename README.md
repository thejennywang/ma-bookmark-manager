This week's project is a bookmark manager. The goal is to expose us to the following aspects of web development, in addition to what we've studied before:

Integration testing: Capybara (Monday)
Relational databases (Tuesday and Wednesday)
Security considerations (Thursday)
In addition to the technologies mentioned above, this project is going to be more challenging on the front-end. Of course, we'll also continue to be using the technologies we're familiar with: Sinatra, RSpec, etc.

Completion time: 3-4 days

High-level specification
==========================

We are going to build a bookmark manager, similar to pineapple.io or delicious.com in spirit. 

A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.

The website will have the following options:

Show a list of links from the database
Add new links
Add tags to the links
Filter links by a tag
